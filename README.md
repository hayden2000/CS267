My work on the project:
- Designing tree 3D models with Unity
- Creating 5 color schemes for random generation of scenery
- Creating 5 sets of textures for every object to match the different color schemes
- Built multiple test terrain-maps to test the design aesthetics
- Implementing weather effects in the scenery
- Implementing script to randomly place trees and objects throughout the scene
- Implementing action scripts for all of the 3D creature objects
